# Overview
Hey, thanks for checking in!

Here's a quick overview for what this is and how I wrote it. Basically, when I was in high school, I got addicted to the game 2048. It had just barely hit the app store, and it's simplicity and complexity made it incredibly fun, and reminded me a lot of one of my favorite games, Tetris. 

As I've been learning to program, I've wanted to learn how to program things like that, things that were fun and simple that could be understood by anyone but could be difficult and entertaining at the same time. Since this game fits that bill, I decided I'd try my hand at programming it, and this is what I've come up with.

# Development Environment

In addition to wanting to program it, I also wanted to improve my skills in Javascript. Since I'm studying web development and software design at the same time, I thought this would be a good chance to apply knowledge of both to this. So, I challenged myself to do it without using Python, C#, or C++ and to make it playable in the browser.

So for this project, I only used Javascript, HTML and CSS and did it all in my preferred IDE, Visual Studio Code. Overall, not complex when it comes to the languages used, but a very good refresher on dynamically generating content and using 2-dimensional arrays to do it.

# Useful Websites

First, wanted to shout out Kenny Yip for the tutorial on how to do it. For the most part, I went my own way but I did have to find some resources when it came to checking gamestate, and this video was incredibly useful for that.

I also needed a small refresher on accessing 2D arrays and generating HTML using them, and this tutorial was very useful for that as well.

# Future Work

As of right now, the program is mostly done. As for things that I would like to change, I'd love to incorporate CSS animations into the mix so that when a block is moved, it slides as opposed to just suddenly appearing, and so I'll be looking into that for the future, so keep an eye out for it!
